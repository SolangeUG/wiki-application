This project is a fully-functional wiki application that has user registration, article submission and edition, 
security, caching, and viewing everything together. The final product is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform 
(via Google App Engine).

## Languages - Libraries - Tools

- [Python 2.7.14][5]
- [Jinja2 templating engine][3]
- [Google App Engine][6]
- Any code/text editor ([atom][7]) or IDE ([PyCharm][8]) of your choice.

## Deploying the application

> Google App Engine allows to build scalable web and mobile backends in any language on Googleâ€™s infrastructure.

In this project, we use the original local development App Engine SDK for Python.
The latest version - `1.9.74` - can be downloaded [here][9].

In order to deploy the application online, you'll need to sign up for a [google account][10], if you don't have one already.

Here's a [video tutorial][11] on how to install and use Google App Engine in creating and deploying applications.
